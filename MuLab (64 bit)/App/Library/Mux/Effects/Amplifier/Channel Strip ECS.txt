The Channel Strip is just as you can expect it.
Input Stage with HP-> EQ -> Compressor -> Saturation -> Limiter -> Output Stage

You can Bypass every stage. The bypass is seamless from 0..100, which means 
parallel compression/saturation/EQ. Automate them to get most out of your tracks.

The EQ has 2 bell shape parametric bands.
To Bypass the Limiter: ALT-Click the box (Black=active; default=inactive).
