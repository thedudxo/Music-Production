Please note that all Pitch Shifter Effects require a note (any note) to run.
It is recommended that you have a (sub)track containing a single note during the parts you use the Pitch Shifter effects.

The Pitch Shifter modules have a spread of about 1 octave down and 7 semitones up.
The Micro Pitch Shifter is the exception with much less than 1 semitone deviation.
Micro Pitch Shifter is meant as a Stereo Widening effect following the principle of a delay on one channel and a slight pitch up on one side and a slight pitch down on the other.

The UP/Down knob has to be set either to Minimum or to Maximum to work as intended.
The 50 percent position is the Bypass, where no pitch shift is applied.
But no one stops you to see what happens in the in-between.
