The "4 Band EQ" is an equalizer module containing a low shelve band, two bell shaped bands and a high shelve band.

Each band shows the usual controls of Frequency, Q and Gain.

The frequency of the bands can span over the entire frequenct range.

The Q factor is restricted to the value of 2 for the shelver and to 4 for the bell shaped bands.
For the shelvers the lowest value of 0.5 results in a smooth increase even below/above the set frequency. 
At a Q factor of 2 the shelves begin to under- and over-shoot around the set frequency and the increase in level is quite steep.
The two bell shaped bands have a bell width of around 3 octaves at Q=0.5 and is around 1/3 of an octave at Q=4.

Gain for all bands can range from -24dB to +24dB.

In the Global Control section you can set the output level, bypass the EQ and shift the entire EQ up or down the frequency range.
With the Bypass EQ you not only can compare against the unaffected signal but you can automate this parameter.
This way you can gradually blend the EQ in or out.
The Frequency Shift allows you to move the entire frequency setup up or down without the need to adjust 
each bands frequency control.


Modules with "Saturation" in their name contain a saturation stage that add small amounts 
of (odd) harmonics when the EQ is driven hard.
