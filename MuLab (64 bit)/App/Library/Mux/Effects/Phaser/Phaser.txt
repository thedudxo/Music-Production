Phaser MKII

How it works:
The Phaser is based on Allpassfilters that do not change
the frequency response, but the phase at frequencies above
the set filter frequency and thus cancel out some frequencies. 
This phaser uses 4 allpass filters, two for the left and two 
for the right side. The filters are modulated with LFOs.

How to setup:

Phaser Settings:
The Frequency knob sets the main frequency around the filters
are modulated.
The Resonance setting creates notches for settings from 0..~30
and peaks above 30.
As there are 2 filters per stereo side the frequency Spread 
of the filters can be changed. At 0 the two filters are at
the same frequency and are set more apart (up) the
higher Spead is set.

Phaser Modulation:
The usual Modulation Frequency (Mod Freq) and Modulation Depth
(Mod Depth) set the LFOs. 
The LFOs can be Detuned (L-R Mod Detune) and phase reversed
(L-R Mod Phase) to get a more lively and random movement.

Note: Experiment with the Dry/Wet setting for best results.
Sometimes a 50/50 is better, sometimes 0/100 is better.
